# Application of Matrix Analysis and computational linear algebra.
This repository contains practice homework projects related to applied aspects of working with matrices and implementing computational linear algebra algorithms in Python.

### Overview of project
lab1 - In this project, I worked with one possible application of singular value decomposition - finding a "good" basis (eigenfaces) in a set of images and using it to find similar images.

lab2 - In this project, I built a recommendation model based on sparse rank approximations of sparse matrices.

lab3 - In this project, I constructed a tomogram of some object using data on the intensity of rays that passed through it. 

lab4 - In this project, I was concerned with calculating voltages in a resistor system and iterative methods for solving linear systems, specifically comparing different iterative methods for solving systems, both modeled and real large and sparse.
